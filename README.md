Heltec Wireless Tracker Case
========

This project contains the top and bottom components for a Heltec Wireless Tracker Case.
Both OpenSCAD and STL files are provided.

Background for this project is in this blog posting: https://gorges.us/meshtastic-dog-tracker/

Hopefully the variable names in the OpenSCAD file are clear enough so one can nake changes.
For example change the $skin_thickness variable to make the case thicker, or the $case_height for a different LiPo battery size.
